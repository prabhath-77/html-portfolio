<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, this is Geedi Prachanda Prabhath. I am currently a student at NIT Durgapur,<br /> 
  pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

<p>I am extremely interested in Web Development and aspire to build a good career as a Web Developer.<br />
  I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly web applications and am continuously enhancing my skills in this domain.

<p>I'm trying to build a solid foundation in programming and web technologies like HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript.<br /> Then I will be working upon Backend as well. Recently, I developed a few projects which will be uploaded soon.
